# Responsive Portfolio

This is a website that acts as a portfolio for me in my web development career. It is designed to be responsive to different media types. It utilizes bootstrap 4 for nearly all of its formatting. There is some minor css styling in the portfolio html. 

The website includes three html pages- an about me section (index), a portfolio gallery (portfolio), and a contact form (contact).
